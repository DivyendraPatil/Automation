# automation


So the idea was to add codeowners files to all repos.

#gitlab.sh
go script goes and iterates over all repos and checks for "codeowners" files
zsh script adds codeowners to the repos given

#aws_renew_script.sh
A script to renew ur aws credentials (not password)

#cron-logging-script.sh
A bash script to log output of all crons in cron.d
